The Deatiled Installation steps are given [here](https://openroad-flow-scripts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/BuildLocally.html) 

Here I will be giving out the steps to be followed. 

Install KLayout (OpenROAD Flow requires KLayout) It can be directly installed from the [Klayout-website](https://www.klayout.de/) 

Make sure the necessary packages are installed : 

a. libffi-devel

b. tcl

c. pandas Python library Available from pip (e.g., python3-pip ) to install pandas: pip3 install --user pandas

Clone and Build:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts
cd OpenROAD-flow-scripts
./build_openroad.sh --local


After the installation is done you can check the working of the OPENROAD & YOSYS by going to the directory /OpenROAD-flow-scripts/tools/install/OpenROAD/bin
and typing the command 

openroad

this will run the openroad you can type 

openraod -gui 

for graphical interface.


Follow the same steps for yosys by going in ~/install/yosys/bin

yosys

yosys -help


NOTE : at the time of installation the setup may end up abruptly one of the reason for that is low RAM/memory availaiblity. Increase the swap memory to deal with this error.
